                    <h2 class="about__subtitle">Introduction üëã</h2>
                    <p class="about__text">Ordering sushi deliveries or food deliveries in general, is a familiar routine for those who work a lot of time outside home and have no free time to cook for themselves or even take time off for lunch outside. Especially in the Corona
                        period when shipping is the only option to enjoy food outside home.<br><br>When I talk about sushi, I mean Japanese cuisine, which boasts its unique ingredients that most people are unfamiliar with. In delivery, unlike sitting
                        in a restaurant, there is no place to chat with the waiter and ask him what each word on the menu says. The customer wants to order a dish that he knows and likes what is in it. He wants to immediately understand what the ingredients
                        are.

            <div>
                <h2 class="about__subtitle">Problem</h2>
                <p class="about__text">When a user opens the restaurant's app to order delivery, he probably does not understand all the words on the menu, there are pictures but usually not large enough to see well what is inside.<br><br>The user is in a state of uncertainty,
                    and uncertainty creates frustration. When the user is frustrated - if he is patient he will continue to try to find words he knows and loves and if he is not patient he will give up and exit the app and will probably order food with
                    less complex words.<br><br>In addition to complex words there is the matter of lack of diversity. If I want to order a sushi roll there is a minimum of 8 "circles" per roll. 8 is too little and 16 is too much, and one way or another
                    I go out with only 2 types of sushi.<br>The sushi ordering experience itself is not very pleasant. üòü

                        The transition between the choices will be easy and pleasant by sliding the thumb, an action that many people do every day and are used to.<br>‚Ä¢ In addition to all these there will be a wide and varied selection of sushi rolls.
                        The minimum will be 4 "circles" per roll. It will be possible to play with the amount depending on the user hunger.<br>‚Ä¢ And of course the user will get to enjoy a number of different types of rolls for a meal.<br><br> The experience
                        of ordering sushi has never been more pleasant and simple! ü§ó

                        deliveries.
                        <br>‚Ä¢ I built a set of questions that deals mainly with how the process happens today and why it is so frustrating.<br>‚Ä¢ Based on the interview findings I created a persona that expresses the main pain points of the users.<br>‚Ä¢
                        Based on all of these I also built a decision-making path through measures of motivation and time.

                    <p class="about__text">Simultaneously with the branding phase it was very clear to me how I was going to design the menu screens based on the typography of the logo. I designed the rest of the screens inspired by apps for ordering food deliveries.
                        <br><br>‚Ä¢ <b>Quick learning</b> - It was important to me that the user go through even the shortest tutorial before starting to use the app, so that all the data he needs is clear to him and he does not have to put much effort
                        to know how to navigate the app.
                        <br>‚Ä¢ <b>Transition between choices</b> - Explanation below.
                        <br>‚Ä¢ <b>Choose and Edit</b> - The user can easily choose the option he wants, and in addition to the selection he gets a visual confirmation of his order. Going to his order screen (his box) he gets another visual confirmation
                        of <u>everything</u> he has ordered and in addition he has a fast and accessible editing capability.
                        <br>‚Ä¢ <b>Contact, Profile and Confirmation</b> - In the user study I discovered that there is something important to keep - (which already exists in apps for ordering food deliveries) and that is - tracking the order and constantly
                        knowing at what stage my order is and when the user should receive it. In addition to confirming an order, I also created a contact screen that includes a chat - the user can chat with a representative if there is any difficulty
                        (this information is also taken from the user research). And of course a profile screen where the user can check or edit his relevant information like addresses, means of payment, repeat orders and more.

                        sushi that represents its roll, the image displayed is large and the user can clearly see what is inside (something that came up in the user study) the name of the roll is below the image and with the movement most of us do daily
                        you can slide with the thumb and switch between different options.<br><br>The transition between the options is friendly and gives a feeling of lightness, pleasure and curiosity to what will come next.

                            <br><br> The answer is simple. It's not "Nothing important should ever be more than two clicks away" or "Speak the users language" or "Be consistent."<br> Its...<b> "Dont make me think!"</b>
                            </i>
                        <br><br> "Dont Make Me Think" by Steve Krug.
                        <br><br> I once read that when a user uses an app that is not well built - he will have a lot to say and especially what to ask, but if the interface is well built probably the user will not have much to say because you made him
                        not think.
                        <br>Following that, hopefully Sushi Box will save a lot of questions from its users and make them not think - but order sushi quickly and efficiently. üòä ‚Äç ‚Äç ‚Äç
